Here is a simple program that creates a random number and allows the user to guess what the number is.TITLE Guess a number (Guesser.asm); 
This program allows the user to guess a random number
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.data
welcome BYTE "I'm thinking of number between 1 and 10. 
"BYTE 'You must guess it.', 0dh, 0ah, 0
prompt BYTE 'What is your guess? ', 0
report1 BYTE 'You guessed: ', 0
report2 BYTE 13, 10, 'The secret number was: ', 0
report3 BYTE 13, 10, 'Thanks for playing', 13, 10, 0
secret DWORD ? ; the secret random number
.code
main PROC
; Welcome user
mov edx, OFFSET welcome
call WriteString; get the random number
call Randomize                        ; initialize the random number generator
mov eax, 10                             ; there are 10 numbers in the range
call RandomRange                   ; random [0..9]
inc eax                                                 ; add 1 to get 1 through 10
mov secret,eax                         ; store the number in memory ; Get user's guess
mov edx, OFFSET prompt       ; display prompt for input
call WriteString
call readInt                               ; get user input into eax ; display the user's 
guessmov edx, OFFSET report1
call WriteString
call WriteInt ; display the secret number
mov edx, OFFSET report2
call WriteString
mov eax,secret                         ; reload the number for output
call WriteInt ; display exit message
mov edx, OFFSET report3
call WriteString 
exit
main ENDP
END main 
Notice how the use of
WriteString and WriteInt requires a "set up" command. 
Each of these procedures expects an argumentto be preloaded in a specific register. 
Passing arguments to procedures via registers is a simple and effective technique. 
Also, note how the strings are defined in the data segment. 
The newline sequences must be inserted at the correct locations so the output is nicely formatted. 
Be sure to null-terminate any strings you plan to display using WriteString.
When you run this program, you should see something like this:
I'm thinking of number between 1 and 10. 
You must guess it.
What is your guess? 6
You guessed: +6
The secret number was: +3
